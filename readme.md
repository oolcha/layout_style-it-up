## The task
Please **DO NOT** change `index.html` though. Change `style.css` so the page works as described below:

- The page consists of a header, a footer, and 9 blocks between them.
- The width of the blocks must be 300px.
- The height of each of the blocks (including both header and footer) has to be 100px.
- When hovered, the block height must increase to 200px.
- Please use these colors:
  - header is `blue`
  - footer is `black`
  - important is `red`
  - interesting is `green`
  - surprising is `orange`
- There should be no vertical spacing between the blocks and the edges of the page.
- Place the blocks so that they are horizontally centered on the page.
